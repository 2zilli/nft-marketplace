# NFT Marketplace

Welcome to the NFT Marketplace coding task for Chromaway! This project demonstrates the basic functionality of a blockchain-based marketplace where users can register, create collections, mint NFTs, and more.

## Project Overview

The goal of this task is to evaluate the ability to learn Rell basics and to create data models. The implementation is minimal but focuses on code formatting, organization, and naming conventions.

## Functionality

The marketplace includes the following features:

-   **User Registration**: Register a new user account.
-   **Create Collection**: Create a new NFT collection.
-   **Mint NFT**: Mint a new NFT, which can be independent or part of a collection.

-   **Buy NFT**: Purchase an NFT.
-   **Favorites Management**: Add/remove collections and NFTs to/from favorites.
-   **Queries and Operations**: Use queries to read information from the blockchain and operations to write data.
